I have done R&D on this using the same layout of the newsletter you have sent. 

It's quite difficult to use the same layout. Because different email client renders the html differently. 

So i would recommend that you provide an image of the newsletter like you sent in ppt file.

I can use the same image in announcment, underneath the image we place a link called view more or for further information that redirects to the sale page.
